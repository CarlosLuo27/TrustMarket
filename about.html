        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            TrustMarket is a non-profit initiative dedicated to rebuilding public confidence in free markets 
            by combating economic misinformation. We believe in making the truth visible, understandable, 
            and accessible to all Canadians.
        </p>

        <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
        <p>
            Viral economic mythsâ€”like grocers making record profits or inflation being caused by secret collusionâ€”
            erode trust in the fairness and transparency of our market systems. These myths spread fast, but facts often don't.
            Weâ€™re here to change that.
        </p>

        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>ðŸ“Š <strong>Transparent Dashboards</strong>: Built in collaboration with economists and industry experts to show real-time data on profit margins, supply chain costs, and inflation drivers.</li>
            <li>ðŸ“² <strong>Social Fact-Checking</strong>: Partnering with platforms like TikTok and Instagram to flag economic misinformation and boost credible, visual explainers.</li>
            <li>ðŸ§  <strong>Media Literacy</strong>: Encouraging a culture of thoughtful skepticism, critical thinking, and economic understanding through education and outreach.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
            When people understand what's true, theyâ€™re less likely to believe whatâ€™s false.
            Our tools donâ€™t just informâ€”they empower. Weâ€™re building a future where trust in markets 
            isnâ€™t based on spin, but on transparency and data.
